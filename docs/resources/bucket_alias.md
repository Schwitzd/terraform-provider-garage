<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `bucket_id` (String) ID of the target bucket (UUID). This must be the bucketâ€™s unique identifier, not another alias.

### Optional

- `access_key_id` (String) Access key ID to which the local alias is bound. Required when `local_alias` is specified.
- `global_alias` (String) Cluster-wide alias name. Global aliases are unique across the cluster and can be used by any access key. Conflicts with `local_alias` and `access_key_id`.
- `local_alias` (String) Local alias name. Local aliases are only valid for the access key given in `access_key_id`. Requires `access_key_id`. Conflicts with `global_alias`.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `kind` (String) Alias type, either `global` or `local`. Computed from the request.
